# Start and monitor conversations

There are two ways to start a conversation. Individually from a contact page by selecting the **Start SMS conversation** action.

Or as the result of a search, using the **SMS - schedule a conversation** action.

In both cases you can set the SMS conversation to be started straight away, or at a time in the future.

Once a conversation has been scheduled, you can monitor it on the SMS conversation tab of the contact.

Clicking on view will show you the questions and answers received for the conversation.

If you choose to start a conversation 'straight away' via the search action, the conversation will only actually start when the SMS conversation scheduled job runs.

Only one conversation can be run at any one time. If you request that a new conversation is started with a contact that already has a conversation in progress, the new conversation will only start once the current conversation finishes.
