# Trouble shooting

If you are experiencing problems with SMS conversation, make sure that you can send and receive SMS as expected using CiviCRM's out of the box SMS functionality.

## Conversations remaining scheduled

A single contact can only carry out a single conversation at a time.  New conversations will not start if there is an existing conversation in progress. If a conversation has been abandoned, you will need to manually cancel the conversation.

Note: future versions of this extension, and the new CiviCRM Dialogflow extension (https://docs.civicrm.org/dialogflow/) support automatic abandoning of a conversation after a period of time.

## Support
